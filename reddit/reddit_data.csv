I can’t offer any explanation of why country sucks more now than it used to, but one thing I do know is, for me, there is something about specific music and songs from some kind of formative period of my life. I am turning 41 later this year and there are certain songs from when I was much younger that really resonate with me. 

Here are a couple of examples: first and foremost, Don’t You Forget About Me by the Simple Minds. I have no clue what the rest of their catalog is all about but for some reason, I just really really love that song. And it goes back a long time. 

Also: Boys of Summer by Don Henley. Something about his voice, and the way the melody progresses. 

Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears. Just speaks to me on some level, I don’t know why. 

To be more on topic, there are certain 90s mainstream country songs that just make me feel a certain way. Strawberry Wine by Deana Carter. Neon Moon by Brooks and Dunn. I Hope You Dance by Leanne Womack. I think, as a preteen, and being in the car with my parents who listened to the local country station, some of these songs just imprinted on me. So I have a soft spot in my heart for 90s Country which looks to be getting pretty shit on in this thread. 

All I’m saying is, maybe certain songs imprint on us at important moments of our life. Formative times. Special events that trigger positive memories. I am finding that regardless of what new music comes out I keep going back to things that make me feel a certain way and those are tending to be older stuff, from when I was pretty young. I can’t really vibe with 70s music, I do enjoy 80s and 90s music and some of the early 00s. It all tracks to important parts of my life and they link up to certain timeframes or events.

There’s simply no other technology that can do the same thing, and the worst case continuity of government plans have always been able to assume there will be millions of cars that can serve as battery operated radio receivers in that situation.  

I don’t think most people realize just how fragile modern communications infrastructure is, and how many scenarios there are that could result in a nationwide long term partial or complete failure of that infrastructure, especially if that was an intentional objective.

In the late 80s, I listened to a lot of “colllege rock.” Then Nirvana spawned an movement in the 90s and it became “alternative” but was, really, alternative to nothing. 

But “college rock?” Still it there, just with a thousand different pigeon holed names.

Charley Crockett is also very good, though I had to listen to a few of his songs to appreciate his sound.

Some of this is subjective, of course. You might not like these songs. But I think they sound great, as good as the best songs from the 90s and before that I love. I like some Conway Twitty.

190,"I'm not even joking when I say it's because of Richard Nixon and George Wallace.

Prior to the 1960s, country was an ""everyman"" kind of music. It had to do with working class people and everyday struggle (Sixteen Tons, Jolene, etc) or it had to do with telling a fantastical story (Big Iron, Mexican Joe, etc).

In 1968, George Wallace ran for President as an independent against Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. He was pro-segregation and put the fear of the racist South into Nixon. One thing Wallace did was play country music to emphasize his ties to the ""working man"" with the very openly racist message being that is a *white* working man.

Nixon was rattled, so he started running tons of ads, primarily on radio, featuring country tunes.

This involved both campaigns directly paying country musicians to make music. If you make a Venn diagram of major stars of The Grand Ole Opry between 1950 and 1968, and musicians paid by the Republican party to make radio music for ads, the overlap is significant.

The problem with this is the Republican Party hasn't been in favor of ""the working man"" since long before that. In fact, they hated the working man, but at least until the 80s and Ronald Reagan it didn't quite matter as much. When Ronnie ""Union Busting"" Reagan got in charge, he started pretending his movie-star millionaire ass was a cowboy by wearing jeans and a cowboy hat, even though he was a movie star who grew up rich in a big city.

Tl;dr, the Republican party paid country artists tons of money to make bland music, and the entire genre was white washed as a result and never got away from that.",positive

Back in the day, country music was for a portion of the country that defined themselves are hard working, independent spirited, resilient, ""good people.""  You had guys like Kris Kristofferson, who stood by sinead oconner and whispered words of support in her ear when she tore up the photo of kiddie raper ringleader pope.  You had Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, who are support causes to bring the world together and lift children so they can thrive.  Plenty more examples.

Unfortunately, that slice of America has now embraced being, well, trash.  They have embraced a *new* frame defined by a lack of education, bigotry and intolerance, opioid addiction, and doing literally anything that scientists say is bad.  Covid?  No mask no vax no distancing - why are so many of us dying?  Environment?  Let me roll coal and dump waste.  Why is my drinking water poisoned?  

The country music of today chases that audience.  It serves to reinforce the frame.  The songs are either about being a lovesick girl or a piece of crap.

269,"From what I have gathered there is a pretty huge factor in why pop country is so trash.

It's rap music.

Now I'm a huge rap fan, so I'm not saying rap is trash - it can be, but most of it is not in general. This holds true to country in general as well, because when you want to find good music, it exists even if genres you hate. But when you're looking at the largest reaching, lowest denominator music (pop*genre), you will always find trash.

That caveat aside, it's rap music, disguised as country music, so it's already disingenuous (which makes it trash) but it does so in a way to exploit and deceive the country fans.

At best it's rap music for people who hate rap. At worst it's rap music for people who hate the people who make rap.

One of the most egregious example of this is ""Fancy Like."" This is a rap song, but I promise you, that of the 117Milliom views this has on YouTube on one video alone, a huge majority of people who have watched this, most would say rap is the worst genre of music.

This tactic has been employed for decades now, since rap became main stream. I'm sure you would be able to plot the trajectory of the two genres colliding as rap became more popular and mainstream, and thus exploitable - with country trending towards rap at a greater rate than rap did with country.

From what I have seen, having been following rap virtually my entire life, this was very evident to me and I think the bad faith in which this progression occurred plays one if the major factors in why pop country is so terrible.

No electronic purchases. No bots buying everything up. No third party ticket reseller companies. The band made money selling cassettes, CDs, and merchandise in the venue lobbies. 

Oh, and all our bands actually played their instruments and performed. No lip sync. No standing there playing a pre-recorded song and faking pressing buttons because they’re a “DJ” (even the electronic artists like Front 242 actually performed their music live.)

315,"When grunge killed hair metal that entire industry just packed up and moved to Nashville.

Garth was really good at first and he was as massive a star as anyone on the planet. It was just country rock but it was solid music. Some real classics came out around then.

Then a stadium rock producer (Mutt Lange) met Shania Twain, they made a zillion dollars, and that was the standard for what a country star was now.

After that, it became hit chasing for what was the best of the genre (Garth, Dwight, Brooks and Dunn, et al).  The shows got bigger, so they needed songs that sound good in stadiums and at festivals. Insert drum machine and bass drops. The talented musicians and songwriters who weren't MTV pretty began to get sidelined because they didn't fill stadiums. (Mary Chapin Carpenter, Lyle Lovett, etc.)

CMT started to become a thing, so now it was about looks even worse that before. Ridiculous fashion choices, posses of people with every star. The money was obscene. The music began to sound focus grouped, with ridiculous pandering to the white rural demographic.

There was a backlash to the saccharin bullshit and homogenous sound that was called Alt-Country. Much of is was really quality music (Wilco, Old 97s, Drive-By Truckers, etc.) and people started to fade away from the CMT/ Hair Country sounds.

So the Nashville machine created pseudo alt-country stars. Basically, it was more arena rock only they would fade a fiddle or steel guitar into the mix, throw in a mandolin and an acoustic song or two. The formula worked, so they repeated it again and again.

Now, you had a generation of kids who had literally grown up listening to this kind of country. It began to place itself as the music for good patriots, for the conservative voice and as the one true sound of rural America. Kids aren't that discerning, and they had been listening to the Mutt Lange formula of country for their entire lives.

Then American Idol went BOOM. The problem was that none of the stars had any legs after the show finshed, except Kelly Clarkson. They had a couple of winners move into ""country-lite"" sounds. But Carrie Underwood changed that. Carrie's biggest hit was ""edgy"". She was otherworldy beautiful. The marketers and promoters noticed. Now the star-making machine of reality TV was in charge of what the music was going to be.

But it got silly again. Basically rhinestone  hip-hop with a steel guitar. New, young stars, to differentiate themselves, began to dress down to appear more ""authentic"". But they couldn't get over the machines control of the sound. They became packaging for a uni-sound cranking out same-sounding songs hoping for a few weeks on the charts.

335,"A complete answer needs to discuss the role of the [1996 Telecommunications Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_homogenization) and how it let megacorporations gobble up most of the radio stations in the US.

These gigantic corporations own thousands of radio stations but they don't hire DJs to choose music for each one, because that would cut into their profits. Instead, they run algorithms and program playlists so that everything is pretty much the same across all their stations that share a format.

As a result, artists have an incentive to chase the mainstream, to play for the algorithm and not for any specific audience. Instead of regional variation and local texture, the programmers go for the broadest appeal possible. So the music has that [pandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7im5LT09a0) feel to it.

Audiences for these radio stations accept that what they are hearing is what  country music is. It's identity as aesthetic; a person wants to listen to country because that is just the kind of person they are, so they listen to country radio to learn what kind of music the person they are listens to. Whatever the algorithm chooses, that's what they are fans of, because some pre-recorded announcer keeps reminding them. ""This is Country Music!""

You will have to rely on internet radio rather than over the air broadcasting.

Ultimately, it's the same as pop music.

Who can blame them when streaming has rendered live performances as the only available source of meaningful income for bands? It’s for this reason why you see the continued rise of platinum seats and vip programs at shows. Also, bands want to have positive relationships with TM because they run so many of the best venues, and, somewhat ironically per this article, tm actually has the best ability to fight scalpers compared to other ticketing agents. Like, if you wanna avoid outrageous fees, you can work with a venue that runs its own ticketing system, but they’ll have no real way to fight scalping - not like tm and it’s army of programmers, anyway. Finally - many growing bands don’t want to cancel 7k tickets because you’re not actually solving the problem when you do this. The scalpers don’t actually get punished - it’s the innocent people who buy from them that get really inconvenienced. They often don’t even know their tickets are cancelled until they arrive at the show. A reactive measure like this isn’t beneficial - the best we can do is be proactive at the point of sale.

The music machine (producers) in Nashville used to be called the Country music mafia.

It's about expanding their demographics?  How does that explain the horrid Country artists we suffer with now, like Blake Sheldon, or that  or another clone who sings about trucks, and beer?  If they had takent I'd be more forgiving, but no they are just clones of guys with average voices, whom can  fit into Lee jeans, with the slight exception of Chris Spapelton.  Slight exception.  Chris Stapleton might have been a backup act for Walan back in the days.  I'm glad we have him though.  Would I pay for his music?  No.  Would I go to a close free concert--maybe.

(Cash, and Walon, used to room together when they were comming up.  Walon knew they were going to eat well when Johnny had flour on his pants.  Cash did the cooking.  Years later, Cash felt that Walon didn't have what it took to be big in the industry.  Could anyone imagine thinking Walon wouldn't make it?  Cash said it in a nice way in front of Walon.  I probally am too biased with Walon.  I worked setting up office cubicles as a 10 year old during a summer in Sacramento.  Clem, my boss, had one request.  It was we listen to country music, and Walon was huge that summer.)",positive

When rock music started to die out country music took over the market filling the Gap, so you got a lot of ""save a horse ride a cowboy"" type of songs that were more rock than country.

426,"Well, a lot of people seem to really like that stuff. Let's face it, a lot of people really liked lame rock, yacht rock, etc, etc. *Other people and their taste, huh?*

;-)

But, yeah, like you, I've been definitely turned off by contemporary country since the 1980s at least. I prefer roots country or, like you, classic countrypolitan from the '60s and '70s.

But other folks like rock-like fuzz guitars, programmed beats and auto-tune vocal effects, and the music follows the numbers.

That's why I've been glad to have Tidal and the My Daily Discovery Mixes on my side to feed me both classic norteñas and classic American country, including music (like some of the Americana listed by others in this thread) I'm not familiar with and haven't already heard to death, which is moderately tough to do. I've 'trained' it to give me a very eclectic mix across a number of genres (and even mostly avoid obvious Auto-Tune).

But, you know, while you and I don't care for modern country, a lot of folks seem to.

*From my perspective, even though there is definitely music -- and a lot of it -- that I don't like, I figure that's just me.*

*As far as I'm concerned, when you get down to it, there's no such thing as bad music...* there's just music you like and music you don't like. *If someone likes a piece of music, to them, it's a good piece of music.*

Art imitates life, and life is packed with clutter from products, cheap piety, and cloying patriotism.

For every FGL there's a Maddie and Tae or a Highwoman. For every Pitbull there's a Talib Kweli. And some people have range across the spectrum of their genre, from archetypical pablum to powerful authenticity - John Legend in soul, Maren Morris in country.

Ultimately it depends what you're looking for though, if you want traditional, stick with older stuff.

The problem is those in charge of the largest labels in any genre are deciding which artists to promote and make popular and even putting limitations on those artists' content to make sure it is the exact lyrical and musical and even aesthetic content for the specific target audience they are cultivating.  To be fair, not every song that comes out of this system is bad, but the scene for any given genre is starting to feel more bland and one-note compared to peoples' vibrant and diverse tastes.

The music you want is still being made out there somewhere, but it is likely not being promoted to you as aggressively, so it can be more difficult to find exactly what you're looking for.  Thankfully, with today's increased accessibility to technology and the internet it is easier for independent artists to make and distribute their music on their own.  This means there are probably more artists recording the type of music you want to hear than there were back in the day when artists without a label would have needed to be able to afford access to a recording studio and the means to press and distribute their records on their own.",positive

636,"It’s been my long-time opinion that country quickly became a satirization of itself during the early to mid 2000s. I honestly don’t think it was the “pop-ification” of the genre that became the downfall. I think country became more interested in “being a country music star” and lost interest in the folk aspect of country music as it originated.

Said another way, over the years talent and production quickly became over-interested in *looking* and *acting*, or *appearing* to be a country artist without caring as much for the product itself.

Imagine what would happen if you task a bunch of people who have never heard of country music before to do their best to mimic the industry with only a weekend of exposure to that world. 
What you have left is awfully similar to how people tend to make fun of country with limited connection to the classics:
Beer & trucks & crying in the rain & guitars & hats & walking around with swagger.

Honestly, it’s not that dissimilar to what’s happened to rap music over recent decades. A bunch of folks not connected to the culture are *acting as if* they are in order to sell the facade needed to sell the product or to be seen as famous.

So, we have a bunch of folks who’ve never heard of Conway or Strait or the other legitimate classics (other than a superficial google or quick listen), but who want to be seen as an amorphously defined “country star” (see above for Beer&Hats&Guitars), who all sound nearly identical (fake southern twang, autotune), leading to the standard of music for modern country.

1. The barrier of entry to a music career in general is much lower than it used to be. Now, it’s just as much about virality and attractiveness as it is talent, if not more so. 

2. In addition to that, the barrier of entry to country particularly is lower than other genres. It’s highly driven by aesthetics, but the demographic for “mainstream” country (with a few notable exceptions for progressive artists) has trended far more conservative for the past few years. 

3. So take those two things—an industry that cares more about virality and aesthetics than talent, catering to an often conservative base—and you have an extremely easy formula to hack. Middlingly-attractive person makes song about church or guns or whatever, song goes viral among main demographic 

4. I’ve also noticed there are very few real country stars anymore (again, with a few notable exceptions), and instead you get these artists who are super popular for maybe a year and then fizzle out. Because they aren’t really artists, and they aren’t really talented at music, and honestly they probably don’t really believe in what they’re doing. they’re just good at hacking the formula.

Very good with guitar hrself as well, so that could be a start. 
Wasn't/isn't my genre either but seeing a younger person play this well and adoring country stars hits different than all the country we generally see and hear around us. At least for me here in NL for the past 30 years.

653,"9/11. I’m serious. It was already moving into a poppy direction in the 90s but 9/11 truly sprung it into this weird nationalistic garbage. It became over produced and unauthentic. Im sure a lot of people aren’t old enough to remember, but after the attack country music was just weird propaganda for like 2 to 3 years, and country stars that either spoke out against Bush, or Iraq quickly got pushed out of the scene. While even a little more poppy at the time, the Dixie Chicks are the prime example of this. 2001-2003 also defined that obnoxious look and sound you’ve been hearing for 20 years. 

Simultaneously as the 2010’s hit and rock started to fizzle out of mainstream, country filling in that gap and started being the new rock stars for a lot of people. I can’t remember where I was reading it, but someone did a breakdown of production costs and country musicians have some of the most expensive gear when touring.  It became musicians with $4k guitars, $100k trucks, $100 jeans and t-shirts, $200 hats and boots all singing about that good simple country life.",negative

Red dirt/outlaw country is mostly off-label/independent, with raw lyrics that paint incredible stories full of victory, hilarity, or heartbreak. From the west all the way to Appalachia and even down to Mexico, the roots are there, just not as loud as what is played on the radio.

Country music thematically has always been a problematic genre. It might be the alcoholism, it might be the blind and extreme nationalism. Spousal abuse? There were a lot of things wrong with country even before the end of the golden era. The singers of the prior era sold country well and society was less wise to the capitalist consumption mantra that has further infected it. It just hasn't aged well and memes about it have propped up the glaring problems that stand out even among the greats.

Musician Ryuichi Sakamoto dies at 71 after battling cancer  
April 2, 2023 21:15  
   
Sponichi reported that Ryuichi Sakamoto passed away at the age of 71 on the 2nd.  
According to an interview with Sponichi, he died at a hospital in Tokyo on March 28.  
In his later years, he battled cancer, but remained passionate about making music until the end.  
Ryuichi Sakamoto dies at 71  
According to an interview with Sponichi, he died at a hospital in Tokyo. Sakamoto's management company ""Cab"" in Japan also announced, ""Ryuichi Sakamoto passed away on March 28, 2023 at the age of 71."" He was diagnosed with rectal cancer in June 2020, and announced that it was stage 4 with metastasis to both lungs. ""Cab"" said, ""Even though I was undergoing cancer treatment, I continued my creative activities in my home studio on days when I was feeling well, and spent my days with music until the end.""  
In the 1980s, he created a worldwide hit with his trio band ""Yellow Magic Orchestra"" (YMO). He is also known for his film music, and in 1988 he became the first Japanese to win the US Academy Award for Best Original Score for the US film The Last Emperor. He continued to fight cancer in his later years, but he devoted himself to making music until the end.  
The piano solo concert, which was broadcast worldwide on December 11th last year, was his last public appearance. Pre-recorded in mid-September of the same year. Considering his physical strength, we played a few songs a day and made it into a concert over several days. Immediately after the death of Yukihiro Takahashi (age 71), who was active together in ""YMO"" in January this year, he posted a gray image on SNS. There was no comment, which, on the contrary, gave a hint of heartbreak.  
In early March, he sent a letter to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and others, requesting a review of the redevelopment of Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Gaien. In a written interview with Kyodo News delivered on March 29, he revealed the current situation, saying, ""Both my energy and physical strength are declining to the point that it's difficult to make music."" Mr. Sakamoto passed away on the 28th, and the interview was delivered the next day.  
He was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in 2014 and was in remission after treatment. But in June 2020, when he was diagnosed with rectal cancer, he was told he had ""6 months to live"" without treatment. In surgery, the primary tumor where the cancer first developed, two livers, metastasized lymphatic tumors, and 30 centimeters of the large intestine were removed. He underwent six surgeries in a year, including removing cancer that had spread to both lungs. Since then, he has been in the hospital and has been on medication.  
He started playing the piano at the age of 3 and fell in love with Bach's music in the second grade. After studying composition at Tokyo University of the Arts, he formed YMO with Mr. Takahashi and Haruomi Hosono (75) in 1978. In 1979, the music that used innovative synthesizers at the time was received overseas, and he successfully completed two world tours. In Japan, it has become a social phenomenon, with the Takenoko tribe dancing to the hit song ""Rideen"".  
He was also active as an actor, co-starring with British rock singer David Bowie (died in 2016 at the age of 69) in the movie ""Merry Christmas on the Battlefield"" released in 1983. The kiss scene between the men also performed enthusiastically and became a hot topic.  
In 1988, he became the first Japanese to win the US Academy Award for Best Original Score for the American movie ""The Last Emperor"" (released in 1987), in which he worked on the music for the play and also appeared in it. The album also won the Grammy Award, the highest honor in the American music industry. He became the first Japanese to win the two major titles in the US entertainment industry.  
He was intelligent and was nicknamed ""Professor"". His interest is the driving force, and Mr. Sakamoto has worked hard on what he wanted to do without being bound by established values. Until the end, he continued to express his views on music and life and death in a series of articles in the literary magazine Shincho.  
The ""report"" of the management company ""Cab"" is as follows.  
 the report  
Our musician/artist Ryuichi Sakamoto passed away on March 28, 2023 at the age of 71. We are pleased to report.  
While receiving treatment for cancer, which was found in June 2020, he continued his creative activities in his home studio on days when his physical condition was good, and spent his days with music until the end.  
I would like to once again express my deepest gratitude to all the fans who have supported Sakamoto's activities, all the people involved, and all the medical workers in Japan and the United States who have done their best to heal from his illness.  
We would like to inform you that due to Sakamoto's own strong will, his funeral will be held only by close relatives. In addition, we respectfully decline any requests for condolences, condolence gifts, or flower offerings.  
Finally, I would like to introduce a passage that Sakamoto liked.

So the radio/music people got together and pushed a more modern style singer. Conway twitty, John Denver , willie Nelson George straight randy Travis ect. They all grew in popularity until the Garth brooks movement happened. You see Garth was the first country artist to transition to pop culture and became a mega star. You can see a lot of the same parallels with his career as Taylor swifts. Anyway once that Garth sound became hugely popular a bunch of similar sounding artists came along and country became pop.

921,Personally i miss hearing a nice smooth country baritone/bass voice. Part of what i find insufferable about bro country is their cheese grater vocals. They sound like braying donkeys. It's all vocal fry.,fear
922,It's amazing they haven't done something about this yet. Just have the tickets registered to a person who needs to show ID on the door. If it's less than 3 tickets transfer is free in the event of sickness but more than that charge per ticket and they can only transfer 6 tickets per concert. Etc. Something like that,fear

927,"Same thing that's been happening in all other genres. The artists are all getting bought out and consolidated into mega corporate record labels. Those labels, in their pursuit of dollars, have found the mathematically most attractive formula to write a country song.

937,"Country Music is perennially ripe for disruption. 

This is exactly why we have greats like Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and down the line Dwight Yoakum and so many other greats that upturned the chessboard and made their own game.

Country music is a genre that constantly reverts to the mean of an overproduced paint-by-numbers sound only to be completely uprooted by those framed as outlaws and/or “alternative”. 

You can overlay almost every upbeat hit country song for the last ten years and it’s more or less the same song. These tracks are often written by committee and follow the formula that “works”. With notable exceptions of course.

Rest assured it’s all going to cycle back into something wholesome, because as soon as whatever sound on the horizon hits it will destroy everything facile currently happening.",positive

944,"I agree for the most part.

I have found several albums that *kinda* fit into the ""Country"" category that I really enjoy.

John Mayer made two country albums. It's probably a bit more like folk, not sure, as those two intertwine a lot. He's got a bunch of the greatest old school musicians on there as well.

Ween made a country album. They as well got a bunch of great musicians to make the album with them, and a lot of the songs are genuinely good.

And this one coming out of Left Field. Ever hear of Rhett & Link? They're YouTube ""stars"", and started out making silly songs. They've got a daily morning show on YouTube called ""Good Mythical Morning"", and it is a lot of fun.

Rhett made a full album that is very folky. Not typically the type of music I'd listen to, but it is very well done. The album itself is about Rhett's ""deconstruction"" from being heavily religious into a non-believer. It is amazingly touching, and I was heavily weeping while listening to it at work the other week.

It was the very first time listening to the album as a whole, and several of the songs just had me weeping, streams of constant tears flooding down my face. Wow.

So there's four albums I'd recommend for those who don't typically like country music.",positive

948,"I'd go more towards the bluegrass genre and you'll find some of the better ""country"" acts of today. People like Billy Strings, Molly Tuttle, Sierra Hull, Sierra Ferrel. There's a whole lot more than that but I've just dipped my toe in that genre for about 8 months now. A huge group of young musicians have created a pretty nice scene in Nashville with a more original modern sound.   
Oh yeah, check out Colter Wall. I think you might like him.",positive

958,"It's ""trashy"" because it's a reflection of the under educated, poor, over materialistic audience; a result of a brain wash populace being controlled by pro-corporate government and, what tends to be, pro-authoritarian churches that are both, at their core, anti-education/anti-science. That kind of B.S. leaves no room for an appriciation of what came before (the music you listed), or nuance, or original thought; so the corporations making the music pander to the lowest common denominator (because it's viewed as a safer investment) therefore ""trashy shit"".",positive
